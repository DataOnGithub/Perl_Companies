A quick and dirty script to generate a list of companies which use Perl.

The script uses the postings from jobs.perl.org to generate the list.

This project is a fork of brian d. foy's jobs.perl.org-jobs-counter and owes a large debt to him for it.

Much of the inspiration for this project came from Jeff Thalhammer.
